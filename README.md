# looks-good-to-meme

Fun and maybe useful memes to spice up your code review

This repo lists a selection of juicy memes to put some
fun into otherwise boring PR review, with reasonable and
consistent image sizes.

Feel free to browse and borrow, and no need to cite
this as source, either way it's mostly stolen out of
imgflip, programmerhumor.io and places...
